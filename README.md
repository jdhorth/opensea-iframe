This is the code for embedding an OpenSea collection into a page
using an iframe tag and a little bit of styling. 

This branch adds the top nav bar feature. 
A responsive bootstrap nav bar that nests itself for mobile screens.
You can easily create multiple OpenSea collections embedded with iframes,
and add them to your nav bar.

If this has been helpful. Sub, star and become a fan or buy me a coffee! Cheers.
